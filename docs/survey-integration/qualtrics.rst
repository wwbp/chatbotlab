Qualtrics Integration
=====================

Overview
--------

Use ChatbotLab to embed conversational tasks into your Qualtrics survey pages.

.. important::

   Note that your Qualtrics account must be able to edit JavaScript. 
   Some institutions disable this for security reasons. Contact your Qualtrics 
   administrator if iframes are not permitted.

Data Needed to Embed Bot
------------------------

ChatbotLab Domain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Deploy ChatbotLab first, following the :doc:`/deployment/index` guide. You
will then have a domain name for your chatbot. Use it in place of
``<YOUR-CHATLAB-DOMAIN>`` below.

Survey ID
^^^^^^^^^

1. Navigate to your survey.
2. Click on Distributions.
3. Click on **Anonymous link**. If needed you can generate one.
4. Copy the survey ID from the link. It typically starts with ``SV_`` (for example, ``SV_cBaJiOettfQqZRY``).
5. Replace ``<SURVEY-ID>`` with your survey ID in the code below.


Bot Name
^^^^^^^^

1. Navigate to the ChatbotLab admin panel and login. 
2. On the left, under CHATBOT, click on `Bots`.
3. You can use the search bar to find your bot.
4. Copy the name under the NAME column.
5. Replace ``<BOT-NAME>`` with your bot name in the code below.

Alternatively, this could be created in your survey flow and saved to an Embedded Data
field. For example, if your embedded data field was called ``model`` then you would
replace ``<BOT-NAME>`` with ``${e://Field/model}`` in the code below. This allows you
to build sophisticated survey flows and serve different bots depending on how your
participants answer survey questions.

.. important::

   This **must** exactly match the bot name in ChatbotLab's database. 

Study Name
^^^^^^^^^^

This is a descriptive name for your study, which will be saved in ChatbotLab's. For example, 
if you study was related to a therapy bot, you could call the study ``therapy_bot``. We
recommend keeping the name simple, yet descriptive, so that you can distinguish 
between multiple studies. Replace ``<STUDY-NAME>`` with your name in the code below.

Participant ID (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You may also have an ID for your participant saved in an Embedded Data field. This
could be a Prolific or Mturk Worker ID. If so, you can replace ``<PARTICIPANT-ID>`` with
your embedded data, for example ``${e://Field/pid}`` if your embedded data field is ``pid``.
If you do not have this then you can set this value as the Response ID ``${e://Field/ResponseID}``,
i.e., a unique identifier for each row in your survey data.

Embedding ChatbotLab
---------------------

1. Deploy ChatbotLab on AWS following the :doc:`/deployment/index` guide.
2. In Qualtrics, add a **Text / Graphic** question.
3. Open the JavaScript editor. This is typically on the left under Edit Question -> Question Behavior
4. Add the following code in the editor under Edit Question JavaScript:

   .. literalinclude:: qualtrics/embed_chatbot.js
      :language: javascript

   This file also lives in the repository at
   ``docs/survey-integration/qualtrics/embed_chatbot.js`` so you can copy it
   directly.

5. Replace the placeholders:

   - ``<BOT-NAME>``: your bot's name
   - ``<STUDY-NAME>``: your chosen study label
   - ``<SURVEY-ID>``: your unique Qualtrics survey identifier
   - ``<YOUR-CHATLAB-DOMAIN>``: your ChatbotLab domain, from deployment
   - ``<PARTICIPANT-ID>`` (optional)
6. You may also want to add instructions on the task to your **Text / Graphic** question.
7. Save and preview the form to verify that the chat window loads correctly.

Passing Data
------------

You can send other data to ChatbotLab's backend database by adding additional variables and 
appending them to ``botURL``.

   .. code-block:: javascript

         var someSurveyQuestion = "${e://Field/some-question}"; 
         ...
         botURL += "?survey_question_response=" + encodeURIComponent(someSurveyQuestion);

Note that the entirety of ``botURL`` is saved as a raw string in ChatbotLab's backend,
which allows you to send arbitrary amounts of data from your survey without modifying
the database structure (i.e., you can parse variables from the raw string at a later date).

Sending Survey Answers to the Bot
---------------------------------

The ``Passing Data`` section above appends values to the chatbot URL, which
stores them for later analysis but does not show them to the bot. If you want
the bot to *read* a participant's earlier answers during the conversation —
for example, a condition where the bot knows what the participant said they
were stressed about — send them to ChatbotLab's survey endpoint instead.

This path has no length limit and no fixed number of questions, and the
answers never appear in the participant's URL.

Step 1 — Issue a token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The endpoint is authenticated, and **rejects every request unless a token is
configured**. Issue one from the admin panel — no redeploy or AWS access
needed:

1. Open **Survey ingest tokens** in the admin panel and click **Add**.
2. Write a note saying which study the token is for, e.g.
   ``Stress study, wave 1``. The note is only for your own reference.
3. Save. The token is generated for you and shown under **Token** on the
   next screen — copy it from there.

Issue a separate token per study. When a study finishes, open its token and
untick **is active** to revoke it immediately; the record stays for your audit
trail.

.. warning::

   Anyone holding a token can submit survey answers for any participant, so
   treat it like a password. Do not paste it into anything participants can
   see — it belongs in the Qualtrics Web Service header, which runs
   server-side, never in survey JavaScript.

.. note::

   Deployments that would rather manage the secret as infrastructure can set
   the ``SURVEY_INGEST_TOKEN`` environment variable instead (for Terraform,
   ``survey_ingest_token`` in ``terraform.tfvars`` or the matching GitHub
   Actions secret; for local development, ``api/.env``). Both work at the same
   time, so an environment-managed token and admin-issued tokens can coexist.

Step 2 — Add a Web Service element to your survey flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Qualtrics, open **Survey Flow** and add a **Web Service** element.

.. important::

   Place the Web Service element **after** the questions you want to send and
   **before** the block containing the chatbot. Qualtrics executes flow
   elements in order, so a Web Service placed after the chatbot will deliver
   the answers too late for the conversation to use them.

Configure it as:

- **URL:** ``https://<your-chatbotlab-domain>/api/survey_response/``
- **Method:** ``POST``
- **Body:** ``application/json``
- **Header:** ``X-Survey-Token`` set to the token from Step 1

The JSON body:

   .. literalinclude:: qualtrics/web_service_body.json
      :language: json

   This file also lives in the repository at
   ``docs/survey-integration/qualtrics/web_service_body.json``.

Both the question text and the answer are sent, because the bot reads the
question wording as part of the context. Add as many entries as your study
needs — the number of questions and the length of each answer are uncapped.

.. note::

   ``survey_id`` and ``participant_id`` must match the ``survey_id`` and
   ``participant_id`` you put in the chatbot URL (see ``Embedding ChatbotLab``
   above). That pair is how ChatbotLab finds the answers again.

Sending the same participant's answers twice overwrites the stored copy rather
than creating a duplicate, so retries and survey restarts are safe.

Step 3 — Turn it on for a bot
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the admin panel, open the bot and find **Survey Context**:

``Survey context preamble``
   The sentence that introduces the answers to the model, for example
   ``The participant answered these questions before talking to you:``.
   The answers are appended underneath it as ``Q:``/``A:`` pairs.

   **Leave this blank to append nothing.** This is how you configure a control
   condition: point the control condition at a bot with an empty preamble and
   the treatment condition at a bot with one set. Both bots can otherwise be
   identical, and both still receive the answers — only the treatment bot
   reads them.

``Survey context in followup``
   Whether the answers are also included when the bot sends an idle follow-up
   message. On by default. Turn it off if follow-ups should not reference the
   survey.

Step 4 — Verify before running participants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before involving Qualtrics at all, confirm the server side works on its own:

   .. code-block:: bash

      python api/smoke_survey_context.py \
          --base-url https://dev.bot.wwbp.org \
          --token "$SURVEY_INGEST_TOKEN" \
          --bot-name my_test_bot

This performs the same three calls a real study makes and asks the bot to
recall one of the answers, so a pass proves the whole chain end to end. Running
it first separates a server problem from a survey-flow problem, which are
otherwise hard to tell apart. It needs a bot that has a preamble set, and a
server not running with ``MOCK_LLM=true``.

Then take the survey yourself, and in the admin panel check:

1. **Survey responses** — a row for your participant ID with the expected
   number of answers.
2. **Conversations** → your conversation → **Metadata** → ``survey context`` —
   the answers the conversation actually used.
3. **Utterances** → any bot message → ``instruction prompt`` — the full prompt
   sent to the model, with your preamble and the ``Q:``/``A:`` pairs in it.

If ``survey context`` is empty but the survey response row exists, the two
``participant_id``/``survey_id`` pairs do not match, or the Web Service ran
after the chatbot block.

.. warning::

   A participant whose answers never arrive is **not** an error — the bot
   simply receives no extra context, which silently makes them behave like a
   control participant. Those conversations have an empty ``survey context``
   column, so check it for nulls before trusting your condition assignment in
   analysis.

How it is recorded
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Four records make a conversation reproducible after the fact:

- ``SurveyResponse.answers`` — what Qualtrics sent, and when
- ``Conversation.survey_context`` — a snapshot of what *this* conversation
  used, copied at conversation start. It is a copy, not a link, so it stays
  accurate even if Qualtrics later sends new answers for that participant.
- ``Conversation.bot_config`` — the bot's full configuration at the time,
  including the preamble, so you can prove which condition was live
- ``Utterance.instruction_prompt`` — the exact prompt behind every single
  message

Data Linking
------------

- Each conversation is stored with a ``conversation_id``.
- The variable ``conversation_id`` (in ChatbotLab) can then be merged on the ``ResponseID`` variable in your Qualtrics data.

Keystrokes
----------

You can monitor your participant's typing activity by recording their keystrokes.

   .. code-block:: javascript

      // Function to update time counters and send keystroke data
      function handlePageExit() {
         var currentTime = new Date();
         
         // Ensure we account for time on page before the event
         if (!document.hidden) {
            window.totalTimeOnPage += (currentTime - window.pageStartTime);
         } else if (window.awayStartTime) {
            window.totalTimeAwayFromPage += (currentTime - window.awayStartTime);
         }
         
         sendKeystrokeData();
      }

      // Attach both unload and pagehide events
      Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnUnload(handlePageExit);
      window.addEventListener("pagehide", handlePageExit, false);

      // Function to send keystroke data to external API using both window and sessionStorage flags to avoid duplicate sends
      function sendKeystrokeData() {
         // Check both window and sessionStorage flags
         if (window._keystrokeDataSent || sessionStorage.getItem("keystrokeDataSent") === "true") {
            console.log("Keystroke data already sent.");
            return;
         }
         // Set both flags so that duplicate calls are ignored
         window._keystrokeDataSent = true;
         sessionStorage.setItem("keystrokeDataSent", "true");
         
         var conversationID = "${e://Field/ResponseID}"; // Embedded data from Qualtrics
         var payload = JSON.stringify({
            conversation_id: conversationID,
            total_time_on_page: window.totalTimeOnPage,
            total_time_away_from_page: window.totalTimeAwayFromPage,
            keystroke_count: window.keystrokeCount
         });
         
         if (navigator.sendBeacon) {
            navigator.sendBeacon("https://bot.wwbp.org/api/update_keystrokes/", payload);
            console.log("Keystroke data sent using sendBeacon.");
         } else {
            fetch("https://bot.wwbp.org/api/update_keystrokes/", {  
                  method: "POST",
                  headers: {
                     "Content-Type": "application/json"
                  },
                  body: payload
            })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => console.log("Keystroke data successfully sent:", data))
            .catch(error => console.error("Error sending keystroke data:", error));
         }
      }


Validation
----------

1. Preview your Qualtrics survey.
2. Open developer console (F12) → check for "Generated botURL" logs.
3. Confirm the embedded ChatbotLab iframe loads successfully.

Other Options
-------------

- You may also want to add a timer question which ensures the participant stays on the chat window for a specified amount of time.
